## First 3 Things to Do After Login

### 1. Log in to the Admin Portal
Go to the Admin Portal URL above and sign in with your admin email and password. You'll see the Dashboard with live counts of participants, workers, shifts, and invoices.

### 2. Explore the Dashboard
The Dashboard is your home screen. From here you can:
- See how many participants and workers you have
- Check today's shifts
- View pending invoices
- Jump to any section using the sidebar menu

### 3. Check the Participant Portal
Open the Participant Portal URL in a separate browser tab. Log in with the participant test account. This is what your NDIS participants will see — their appointments, invoices, and budget information.
