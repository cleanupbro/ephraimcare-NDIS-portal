## Bugs Fixed During Testing

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Shift creation was failing | ✅ **FIXED** |
| Dropdown menus had transparent backgrounds | ✅ **FIXED** |

1. **Shift Creation Bug** - The shift scheduling feature had a database issue that prevented creating new shifts. This has been resolved and verified working.

2. **Dropdown Transparency Bug** - Dropdown menus and select boxes were showing transparent backgrounds making the content behind visible. Fixed by updating the UI components with solid background colors.
